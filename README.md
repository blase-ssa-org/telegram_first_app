# Story line

### Bounty Hunters

You are a Monster Bounty Hunter. You're always looking for a new contract for the next monster. But there are many of you, because in addition to the reward of gold coins, there is always a chance to find **a truly powerful weapon** and, thanks to it, become the best bounty hunter.

Here, in a tavern in the forest, all the monster hunters gathered in anticipation of new contracts and adventure. You can always challenge anyone who looks askance at you. But donâ€™t forget to check the rating board, otherwise there may be nothing left of you.
